# Privacy Policy for TidyTabs

**Effective Date: January 14, 2025**

## Overview

TidyTabs ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users organize their browser tabs using AI-powered categorization. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Tab Information

- **What we collect**: Tab URLs and titles from your browser
- **How we use it**: To categorize and organize your tabs into groups
- **Storage**: This information is processed temporarily and is not permanently stored

### API Keys

- **What we collect**: Your OpenAI and/or Anthropic API keys (if provided)
- **How we use it**: To authenticate requests to AI services for tab categorization
- **Storage**: Stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API with base64 obfuscation

### Usage Data

- **What we collect**: Tab access frequency and patterns
- **How we use it**: For the Frequency organization algorithm
- **Storage**: Stored locally in your browser

## How We Use Information

1. **Tab Organization**: We analyze tab URLs and titles to categorize them into meaningful groups
2. **AI Processing**: When using the Category algorithm, tab information is sent to your selected AI provider (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. **Local Processing**: Last Access and Frequency algorithms process data entirely locally

## Third-Party Services

When you use the AI-powered Category algorithm, tab URLs and titles are sent to:

- **OpenAI** (if selected): Subject to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- **Anthropic** (if selected): Subject to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

**Important**: These services process the data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their policies before use.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
- No data is sent to our servers (we don't have any)
- API keys are obfuscated but not encrypted (use at your own risk)
